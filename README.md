#### Problem/Question
If a person uploads a photo of their dog, can we predict the breed of dog? 

#### Dog Breed Identification Tool
A cheaper, faster alternative to your traditional doggie DNA test. Our team used a pre-trained machine learning model called VG-99 which is a convolutional neural network (CNN) to transcribe dog images and predict your dog breed 


#### Tools Used
- Bootstrap/HTML/CSS - For the front end of our webpage, HTML form for uploading an image 
- Flask - Used for file uploading, saves uploaded images to a folder called ‘images’ on the server
- D3 - Used to incorporate graphs that display the predicted dog breeds
- Keras - High level API that builds and trains deep learning models
- TensorFlow - Program to create machine learning models
- VG-99 CNN - Convolutional neural network that is trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database
